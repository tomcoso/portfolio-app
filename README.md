Born in Argentina, Buenos Aires, 1998. I always have had too many interests for my own good, until, by discovering programing, I found a syncretism of art and pragmatism, expression and order.

I am a self taugth front end developer, I enjoy building modern websites and apps that are scalable and tidy. I am open to opportunities to continue developing my skills and move forward in the industry. I love learning new concepts and technologies and exploring new ideas. I never settle with the bare minimum, but pragmatism and readability are always in my mind.
