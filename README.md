# Personal portfolio

This is my personal portfolio site, built with React and Sass.

The layout is minimalistic but intricate, it is a set of 4 slides that fold into view when called from `Home`. Initially I wanted to display a different `Home` styling after each visit to other slides, but I wasn't happy with the results so I ended up going for a more static site, but with subtle background animations for each slide, as well as an ever-present shifting gradient that gives it an edge. Overall it makes it worth going back to the `Home` page after each content page.
